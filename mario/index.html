            <p>In the late 80s, Nintendo wasn't just a player in the video game market; it was the market. While other companies struggled to gain a foothold, the rise of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and the portable Game Boy created a cultural phenomenon that cemented the company's place in history. This data story explores the overwhelming success that defined an era.</p>
            <p>The results are clear:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nintendo's Market Share:</strong> Of the $120.67 million in global sales represented in this data, Nintendo accounted for $100.32 million, a staggering 83.13% market share.</li>
                <li><strong>Top Game:</strong> The best-selling game, Tetris for the Game Boy (GB), sold 30.27 million units, more than the next two top games combined.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This period wasn't just about selling consoles and games; it was about creating a new standard for home entertainment. The combination of innovative hardware, iconic characters, and a massive library of hit titles made Nintendo the undisputed champion of the video game world.</p>
