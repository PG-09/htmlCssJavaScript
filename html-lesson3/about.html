    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My academic journey has always been centered on continuous discovery and problem-solving, culminating in a degree in Data Science and Applied Mathematics. This formal training provided a robust foundation in statistical analysis, algorithm design, and computational thinking, which are skills I apply daily to complex real-world scenarios. I learned the critical importance of not just collecting data, but interpreting it ethically and effectively to drive meaningful decisions.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>When I step away from the keyboard, my primary interest lies in the intersection of nature and technology. I am an avid amateur astrophotographer, which combines my technical skills in equipment setup and data processing with a deep appreciation for the natural world and the vastness of the cosmos. This hobby requires immense patience and precision, traits that translate directly back into my professional work.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>Professionally, my long-term goal is to transition into a leadership role focused on developing sustainable, open-source AI solutions that address pressing societal challenges, particularly in environmental monitoring. On a personal level, I aim to achieve fluency in Spanish and complete a multi-day hiking expedition in Patagonia. These goals—both technical and experiential—are driven by a desire to contribute positively to the world while continually expanding my own horizons and capabilities.
